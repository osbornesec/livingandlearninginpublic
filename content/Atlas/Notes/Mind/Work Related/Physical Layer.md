> [!ROCKET]- ## Encounter (E)

- Key Takeaways:
    - Serves as the foundation for data communication within a network.
    - Primarily concerned with the transmission of raw data bits over a physical medium.

> [!BOOK]- ## Note (N)

- The Physical Layer of the OSI Model is responsible for the actual physical connection between devices, managing the way raw bits are placed onto and retrieved from the network medium.
