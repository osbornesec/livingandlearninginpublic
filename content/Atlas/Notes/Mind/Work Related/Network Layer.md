> [!ROCKET]- ## Encounter (E)

- Key Takeaways:
    - Responsible for routing data packets between devices across various networks.
    - Serves as a crucial link between the data link layer and the transport layer.

> [!BOOK]- ## Note (N)

- The Network Layer of the OSI Model acts as a "postman," efficiently routing data packets from source to destination across different networks, while maintaining the integrity and sequencing of the data.
