- Key Takeaways:
    - Manages dialogue between systems
    - Facilitates communication without focusing on data transmission

> [!BOOK]- ## Note (N)

- The Session Layer of the OSI Model functions as the network dialog controller. It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between applications on different network devices.
