>[!ROCKET]- ## Encounter (E)

- Key Takeaways:
    - Prompt engineering is the process of designing and crafting prompts to elicit desired outputs from generative AI models.
    - Effective prompt engineering requires understanding the capabilities and limitations of the AI model, as well as the specific task at hand.

>[!BOOK]- ## Note (N)

- Prompt engineering is a rapidly evolving field, but some general principles have emerged. For example, good prompts should be:
    - Specific and clear: The prompt should clearly define the task and the desired output.
    - Comprehensive: The prompt should provide all the necessary information for the AI model to complete the task.
    - Succinct: The prompt should be as short and concise as possible.
    - Creative: The prompt can be used to explore new and innovative possibilities.
